### Tune settings
* You can change sensetivity of detection for primary and secondary person. The value should be between 1 and 0. Higher number - higher sensetivity. Suggest start from defoult numbers. Can be float number (like "0.65")
* You can change number of dilute iteration. Dilute iteration needed to dilute long frames with other plans. A long frame is anything longer than 45 seconds. For each iteration, long frames are split in half. Accordingly, it may take several iterations to split a long monologue. We recommend that you start with 3.
