Used `Avalonia UI` & `.NET 7`

End platform: Mac


## How to (for two cameras)
### Prerequisite
* Sequence 25 frames per second
* Nested multi-cam sequence on Track V1. Inside nested sequence

* Rendered audio track for primary person (.wav, 48000, 16kbs)
* Rendered audio track for primary person (.wav, 48000, 16kbs)
* Both tracks should have same duration as nested multi-cam sequence

### Tune settings
* You can change sensitivity of detection for primary and secondary person. The value should be between 1 and 0. Higher number - higher sensitivity. Suggest start from default numbers. Can be float number (like "0.65")
* You can change number of dilute iteration. Dilute iteration needed to dilute long frames with other plans. A long frame is anything longer than 45 seconds. For each iteration, long frames are split in half. Accordingly, it may take several iterations to split a long monologue. We recommend that you start with 3.

### How to run
* Build & Compile - you just needed .NET7 environment
* Or go to `multitrack-switcher/Published/Mac/`folder and just run `PRProjMulticamCreator` - this is compiled mac version of programm
